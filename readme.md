# PROM: PCSX2 Running on Mac
### Run PCSX2 on 64-bit versions of Mac OS without any hassles, for Mojave and above.

PROM is a WINE wrapper still in development intending to run on Mojave and above. Very, very slow development.

## System Requirements

OS: macOS Mojave/Catalina (64-bit only)
GPU: any AMD, Intel Graphics won't work well
RAM: at least 8 GB

## Installation
Installing PROM on your computer can be find here.

## Known Issues

- As security is no longer an issue, the wrapper still is not digitally signed. So the error "PROM.app is damage" still exists. The only workaround to this is to disable Gatekeeper for each time you download a new version of PROM.app before enabling it again.

There will be issues that I do not know about yet. Report them in Issues please, thank you!
